# Bootstrap SASS generation

You must have compass installed to compile: 

> gem install compass

Then make whatever changes you need to make and compile the assets in minimized form

> compass compile --output-style compressed --force

You can also watch the folder while you are making changes: 

> compass watch

But be sure to create the minimised file when you are done.
